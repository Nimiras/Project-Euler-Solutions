# Project-Euler-Solutions

This is a collection of my code to solve the problems from the webside Project Euler: 

https://projecteuler.net/about

The solutions are grouped in folders, wich are named by the programming languages I wrote them in.
Every problem in that particular programming language has it's own file and there is also a "main" file wich is something like a playground for me to test out code before finalizing it.

I'm a hobby-programmer and not a professional computer scientist or developer so my solutions may not be the shortest, most efficient or most elegant solutions.
I highly recoment to solve the problem by yourself before looking up my solutions and compyre them after you tried it.
Thanks for taking a look and have a great day.
